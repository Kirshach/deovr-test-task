# Yay, a test task submission!

This is my first attempt at both Astro and Solid, as I really wanted to try out both, but at the end of the day I got short on time and had to cut some corners. Hopefully it's still not too bad.

Probably the majority of the time I spent on this task was to get the dropdown functionality to work correctly, the rest I did in around three to four hours.

Out of the corners I cut, the most notable one is that I didn't implement the "Load more"/Infinite loading functionality, as I didn't want to spend too much time on it.

Worthy of mention is also the fact that I didn't spend too much time thinking about accessibility and security, so visually impaired users are not as welcome as XSS attacks on my little page.

Joking aside, I would usually search for best practices on each component I write, as I'm not an huge expert in either of those fields, but I didn't have time for that.

Finally, I didn't worry too much about configuring the project itself, as doing so properly would take the entire 8 hours I had to complete the task.

To structure the project, I followed a flavour of Feature Sliced Design approach, so if looks funky, that's why.
